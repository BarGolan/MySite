Welcome to Bar Golan's website

to run the website simply click the "mySite.HTML" file
The HTML file has a few references within:
1.	CSS files: 
	•	mySite.css – the main CSS file following this HTML file
	•	normalize.css – a Reset style sheet. Not all browsers apply the same default rules. Therefore, it is better to reset to default.
2.	mySite.javascript - the main JavaScript file following this HTML file.
3.	Different references to fonts and icon.
